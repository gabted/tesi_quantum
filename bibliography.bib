  abstract = {Barbed bisimilarity is a widely used behavioral equivalence for interactive systems: given a set of predicates (denoted ``barbs'' and representing basic observations on states) and a set of contexts (representing the possible execution environments), two systems are deemed to be equivalent if they verify the same barbs whenever inserted inside any of the chosen contexts. Despite its flexibility and expressiveness, this definition of equivalence is unsatisfactory because often the quantification is over an infinite set of contexts, thus making barbed bisimilarity very hard to be verified.             Should a labeled operational semantics be available, more efficient observational equivalences might be adopted. To this end, a series of techniques has been proposed to derive labeled transition systems (LTSs) from unlabeled ones, the main example being Leifer and Milner's theory of reactive systems. The underlying intuition is that labels should be the ``minimal'' contexts that allow for a reduction step to be performed.             However, minimality is difficult to asses, whereas the set of ``intuitively'' correct labels is often easily devised by the ingenuity of the researcher. This article introduces a framework that characterizes (weak) barbed bisimilarity via LTSs whose labels are (not necessarily minimal) contexts. Differently from previous proposals, our theory does not depend on the way the labeled transitions are built but instead relies on a simple set-theoretical presentation for identifying those properties such an LTS should verify to (1) capture the barbed bisimilarities of the underlying system and (2) ensure that such bisimilarities are congruences.             Furthermore, we adopt suitable proof techniques to make feasible the verification of such properties. To provide a test-bed for our formalism, we instantiate it by addressing the semantics of the Mobile Ambients calculus, recasting its barbed bisimilarities via label-based behavioral equivalences.},

  abstract = {Quantum cryptographic systems have been commercially available, with a striking advantage over classical systems that their security and ability to detect the presence of eavesdropping are provable based on the principles of quantum mechanics. On the other hand, quantum protocol designers may commit more faults than classical protocol designers since human intuition is poorly adapted to the quantum world. To offer formal techniques for modeling and verification of quantum protocols, several quantum extensions of process algebra have been proposed. An important issue in quantum process algebra is to discover a quantum generalization of bisimulation preserved by various process constructs, in particular, parallel composition, where one of the major differences between classical and quantum systems, namely quantum entanglement, is present. Quite a few versions of bisimulation have been defined for quantum processes in the literature, but in the best case they are only proved to be preserved by parallel composition of purely quantum processes where no classical communication is involved. Many quantum cryptographic protocols, however, employ the LOCC (Local Operations and Classical Communication) scheme, where classical communication must be explicitly specified. So, a notion of bisimulation preserved by parallel composition in the circumstance of both classical and quantum communication is crucial for process algebra approach to verification of quantum cryptographic protocols. In this article we introduce novel notions of strong bisimulation and weak bisimulation for quantum processes, and prove that they are congruent with respect to various process algebra combinators including parallel composition even when both classical and quantum communication are present. We also establish some basic algebraic laws for these bisimulations. In particular, we show the uniqueness of the solutions to recursive equations of quantum processes, which proves useful in verifying complex quantum protocols. To capture the idea that a quantum process approximately implements its specification, and provide techniques and tools for approximate reasoning, a quantified version of strong bisimulation, which defines for each pair of quantum processes a bisimulation-based distance characterizing the extent to which they are strongly bisimilar, is also introduced.},

As a consequence, a general framework formally describing communication and concurrency in complex quantum systems is necessary. For this purpose, we propose a model named qCCS. It is a natural quantum extension of classical value-passing CCS which can deal with input and output of quantum states, and unitary transformations and measurements on quantum systems. The operational semantics of qCCS is given in terms of probabilistic labeled transition system. This semantics has many different features compared with the proposals in the available literature in order to describe the input and output of quantum systems which are possibly correlated with other components. Based on this operational semantics, the notions of strong probabilistic bisimulation and weak probabilistic bisimulation between quantum processes are introduced. Furthermore, some properties of these two probabilistic bisimulations, such as congruence under various combinators, are examined.},

In this article, we introduce a symbolic operational semantics for quantum processes directly at the quantum operation level, which allows us to describe the bisimulation between quantum processes without resorting to quantum states. We show that the symbolic bisimulation defined here is equivalent to the open bisimulation for quantum processes in previous work, when strong bisimulations are considered. An algorithm for checking symbolic ground bisimilarity is presented.

  abstract = {Communication is a fundamental and integral part of computing, whether between different computers on a network, or between components within a single computer. In this book Robin Milner introduces a new way of modelling communication that reflects its position. He treats computers and their programs as themselves built from communicating parts, rather than adding communication as an extra level of activity. Everything is introduced by means of examples, such as mobile phones, job schedualers, vending machines, data structures, and the objects of object-oriented programming. But the aim of the book is to develop a theory, the pi-calculus, in which these things can be treated rigorously. The pi-calculus differs from other models of communicating behaviour mainly in its treatment of mobility. The movement of a piece of data inside a computer program is treated exactly the same as the transfer of a message--or indeed an entire computer program--across the internet. One can also describe networks which reconfigure themselves. The calculus is very simple but powerful; its most prominent ingredient is the notion of a name. Its theory has two important ingredients: the concept of behavioural (or observational) equivalence, and the use of a new theory of types to classify patterns of interactive behaviour. The internet, and its communication protocols, fall within the scope of the theory just as much as computer programs, data structures, algorithms and programming languages. This book is the first textbook on the subject; it has been long-awaited by professionals and will be welcome by them, and their students.},

With quite simple encodings, two {$\lambda$}-calculus reduction strategies are simulated very closely; each reduction in {$\lambda$}-calculus is mimicked by a short sequence of reductions in {$\pi$}-calculus. Abramsky's precongruence of applicative simulation [1] over {$\lambda$}-calculus is compared with that induced by the encoding of the lazy {$\lambda$}-calculus into {$\pi$}-calculus; a similar comparison is made for call-by-value {$\lambda$}-calculus.},

Here, the interesting properties of a system are identified with those that are expressible in an untimed version of the Timed Probabilistic concurrent Computation Tree Logic (TPCTL) of Hansson. The definitions are made, and the evaluations carried out, in terms of a general labeled transition system model for concurrent probabilistic computation. The results cover weak simulations, which abstract from internal computation, as well as strong simulations, which do not.},

  abstract = {We have unified quantum and classical computing in open quantum systems called qACP which is a quantum generalization of process algebra ACP. But, an axiomatization of quantum and classical processes with an assumption of closed quantum systems is still missing. For closed quantum systems, unitary operator, quantum measurement and quantum entanglement are three basic components of quantum computing. This leads to probability unavoidable. Along the solution of qACP to unify quantum and classical computing in open quantum systems, we unify quantum and classical computing with an assumption of closed systems under the framework of ACP-like probabilistic process algebra. This unification make it can be used widely in verification of quantum and classical computing mixed systems, such as most quantum communication protocols.},

  abstract = {We introduce an algebra qCCS of pure quantum processes in which no classical data is involved, communications by moving quantum states physically are allowed, and computations is modeled by superoperators. An operational semantics of qCCS is presented in terms of (non-probabilistic) labeled transition systems. Strong bisimulation between processes modeled in qCCS is defined, and its fundamental algebraic properties are established, including uniqueness of the solutions of recursive equations. To model sequential computation in qCCS, a reduction relation between processes is defined. By combining reduction relation and strong bisimulation we introduce the notion of strong reduction-bisimulation, which is a device for observing interaction of computation and communication in quantum systems. Finally, a notion of strong approximate bisimulation (equivalently, strong bisimulation distance) and its reduction counterpart are introduced. It is proved that both approximate bisimilarity and approximate reductionbisimilarity are preserved by various constructors of quantum processes. This provides us with a formal tool for observing robustness of quantum processes against inaccuracy in the implementation of its elementary gates.},
