We have seen that a number of different behavioural equivalences have been proposed in the literature. Noticeably, different works give different concepts of "observable properties" of a quantum process. As in classical process algebra, it is always possible to observe if a process $P$ can perform a classical input or output action, which is the foundation of \textit{labeled} bisimulation or \textit{barbed} bisimulation. The discrepancies in state-of-the-art proposals are mainly about the observable properties of quantum states. In QPAlg, the quantum state is observed only when sent, while in qCCS, the whole "environment" is visible, i.e. all the qubits that are not used by $P$ anymore. In (mixed configuration) CQP there is a again a similar notion of "environment", but what is observable is the environment of the whole distribution, not the environment of the single configurations.

The main purpose of this section is to investigate which are the most natural notions of behavioural equivalence, and how some apparently minor details lead to completely diverse equivalence relations. Being interested in the purely quantum aspect of behavioural equivalence, we will only consider "strong" relations, like strong bisimilarity and strong barbed congruence. The difference between strong, weak and branching relations is in fact a well know "classical" aspect, that simply makes the comparison more complex.

We will first define a \textit{probabilistic saturated bisimilarity} \cite{bonchiGeneralTheoryBarbs2014} for Linear qCCS. Saturated bisimilarity is a solid and general notion of observable equivalence, aiming to capture when two processes can or can not be distinguished by an external observer, i.e. by an arbitraty context. We will describe some example of such a bisimilarity, togoether with a useful property that helps when proving the bisimilarity of two processes.

Then we will analyze some peculiarities of these probabilistic equivalence notions, extending the ideas already discussed in \cite{davidsonFormalVerificationTechniques2012}. In particular, the bisimilarities defined for QPAlg and qCCS and lqCCS, seem to grant the external observer a greater discerning power then what is prescribed by quantum mechanics.
We identify the well established notion of Larsen-Skou bisimulation (as described in \ref{pLTS}) as the cause of these undesired behaviours, and propose a novel notion of \textit{quantum saturated bisimilarity} that represents more correctly the observable properties of distribution of quantum configurations. We believe that this bisimilarity complies with the ideas presented by \cite{davidsonFormalVerificationTechniques2012} for mixed configuration CQP, albeit in a essentially different transition system.

Finally we will rephrase some of the xamples in  the previous chapter in lqCCS, comparing our bisimilarity with the other behavioural equivalence presented in the literature. We will show that our notion of probabilistic saturated bisimilarity for lqCCS is consistent with the open bisimilarity  \cite{dengOpenBisimulationQuantum2012} for qCCS, while quantum saturated bisimilarity is strictly larger.
